# Project Title #
[Spring To Do](https://skovakina.github.io/spring-to-do/)

## About the Project ##
The purpose of this project was to create something that would help your community prepare for the coming of spring. Our team decided to create a to do list site, where a user could create multiple lists.

## Key Functions ##
When a user lands on the page, they will see a "+ Add new list" button which will create a copy of a template "to-do" form. They can then update the title, date, and add a text input, which will be turned into a checkbox list item.

## Technologies Used ##
* Figma
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Webpack
