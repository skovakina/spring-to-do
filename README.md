Project Title: Spring To Do

About the Project
The purpose of this project was to create something that would help your community prepare for the coming of spring. Our team decided to create a to do list site, where a user could create multiple lists.

Key Functions
When a user lands on the page, they first need to click the "+ Add new list" button which will create a copy of a template "to-do" form. They can then update the title, date, and add a text input, which will be turned into a checkbox list item.

Technologies Used

HTML
CSS
Javascript
